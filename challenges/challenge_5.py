BROKEN PIPELINE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Uh oh...  The first rule of being a developer is to never make a 
MISTKAE!
That means that you will never have to fix anything - a real time saver!

It seems that a plucky young developer has created a partially working
ADF pipeline.  The problem?  It's not working as it should...

Perhaps you could lend a hand?

Open ADF and look at the pipeline editor.  There is a pipeline called:
'Broken Pipeline'. 

Run it and see if you can fix it!
